# github---push问题

执行 `git push` 时遇到以下问题：  
```r
> git push
kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
Connection closed by 20.205.243.166 port 22
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

这个链接里讨论了相关问题，并没有完全有效的解决方法，改 ~/.ssh/config 没什么用
